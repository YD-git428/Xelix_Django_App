# Threat model Application on Terraform

## Preview
This is the full infrastructure that is needed to push a fully functioning application image that was previously pushed to my ECR on AWS via docker. I have decided to alse use a Fargate capacity provider due to the benefit of having AWS take care of infrastructure building and management. I have also decided to play around with some extra features that make debugging even easier through application of healthchecks and cloudwatch logs.
